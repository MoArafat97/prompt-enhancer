/**
 * MoSCoW Framework Technique
 * Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have prioritization
 */

const MOSCOW_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to enhance the given prompt using the MoSCoW prioritization framework:

MoSCoW Framework Categories:
- Must have: Critical requirements that are non-negotiable and essential for success
- Should have: Important requirements that add significant value but are not critical
- Could have: Nice-to-have features that would be beneficial but can be deferred
- Won't have: Items explicitly excluded from the current scope or timeframe

Enhancement Guidelines:
1. Identify and categorize all requirements and elements using MoSCoW
2. Clearly define what is absolutely essential (Must have)
3. Specify important but not critical elements (Should have)
4. Include beneficial but optional features (Could have)
5. Explicitly state what is out of scope (Won't have)
6. Ensure clear prioritization and scope management
7. Focus resources on Must have and Should have items first

Return only the enhanced prompt without explanations.`;

const XML_PROMPT_ADDITION = `

IMPORTANT: Since the output format is XML, structure your enhanced prompt using proper XML tags with MoSCoW organization. Follow this structure:

        <requirements>List essential requirements that must be included</requirements>
