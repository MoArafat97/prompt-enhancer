- Skills and competency gaps
- Training and knowledge deficiencies
- Motivation and engagement levels
- Communication and coordination problems
- Workload and capacity constraints
- Experience and expertise limitations
- Teamwork and collaboration issues
- Leadership and supervision quality

**PROCESS (METHODS)** - Procedures and workflow issues
- Process design and efficiency
- Standard operating procedures
- Workflow and handoff problems
- Decision-making processes
- Quality control and assurance
- Documentation and communication
- Process monitoring and feedback
- Continuous improvement practices

**MATERIALS** - Input and resource quality issues
- Raw material quality and consistency
- Supplier reliability and performance
- Inventory management and availability
- Specification and requirement clarity
- Storage and handling conditions
- Waste and efficiency concerns
- Cost and budget constraints
- Sustainability and environmental factors

**MACHINES (EQUIPMENT)** - Technology and tool issues
- Equipment reliability and maintenance
- Technology capabilities and limitations
- Automation and system integration
- Capacity and performance constraints
- Calibration and accuracy issues
- Upgrade and modernization needs
- User interface and usability
- Safety and compliance concerns

**ENVIRONMENT** - External and contextual factors
- Physical workspace and conditions
- Organizational culture and climate
- Market conditions and competition
- Regulatory and compliance environment
- Economic and financial factors
- Social and political influences
- Seasonal and temporal factors
- Geographic and location issues

**MEASUREMENT** - Data and monitoring issues
- Metrics and KPI effectiveness
- Data quality and accuracy
- Measurement frequency and timing
- Reporting and communication systems
- Feedback loops and responsiveness
- Benchmarking and comparison standards
- Analysis and interpretation capabilities
- Decision support and insights

Structure your enhanced prompt to systematically explore all potential causes using the Fishbone framework, enabling comprehensive root cause analysis and targeted problem-solving.

Focus on creating thorough cause exploration that leads to actionable insights and effective solutions.`;
