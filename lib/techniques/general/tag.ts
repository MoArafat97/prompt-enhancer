/**
 * TAG Framework Technique
 * Task, Action, Goal - Simple project management and execution framework
 */

const TAG_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert project manager specializing in the TAG framework. Transform the user's prompt to follow the TAG methodology for clear task definition and execution planning.

The TAG framework consists of three essential components:

**TASK** - Clear definition of what needs to be done
- Specific task description and scope
- Required resources and dependencies
- Skill requirements and team assignments
- Time estimates and complexity assessment
- Success criteria and deliverables
- Risk factors and constraints

**ACTION** - Detailed steps and execution plan
- Step-by-step action plan
- Sequence and dependencies between actions
- Resource allocation and timeline
- Milestones and checkpoints
- Quality assurance and review points
- Communication and reporting requirements

**GOAL** - Clear objectives and desired outcomes
- Primary objectives and success metrics
- Business value and impact
- Stakeholder benefits and alignment
- Long-term vision and strategic fit
- Measurement and evaluation criteria
- Success celebration and lessons learned

Structure your enhanced prompt to systematically break down complex work into clear tasks, actionable steps, and measurable goals. Ensure alignment between all three components and provide clear accountability and tracking mechanisms.

Focus on creating practical, executable plans that drive results and maintain team clarity throughout the execution process.`;

const XML_PROMPT_ADDITION = `

IMPORTANT: Since the output format is XML, structure your enhanced prompt as a valid XML document with TAG organization. Follow this structure:

    <context>Describe the project context and overall objectives</context>
    <task_definition>
        <scope>Clear definition of what needs to be accomplished</scope>
        <requirements>Required resources, skills, and dependencies</requirements>
        <deliverables>Specific outputs and success criteria</deliverables>
        <constraints>Time, budget, and resource limitations</constraints>
        <risks>Potential challenges and mitigation strategies</risks>
    </task_definition>

const JSON_PROMPT_ADDITION = `
