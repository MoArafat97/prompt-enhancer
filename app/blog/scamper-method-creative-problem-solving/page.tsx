# SCAMPER Prompts: 7 Lenses to Unlock Creative Solutions üîç

**TL;DR**: SCAMPER provides 7 systematic approaches to creative problem-solving: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to Another Use, Eliminate, and Reverse. Perfect for innovation, product development, and breaking through creative blocks.

SCAMPER is a creative thinking technique that transforms any challenge into multiple innovation opportunities. By systematically applying each lens, you can generate dozens of unique solutions that might never emerge through traditional brainstorming.

## What is SCAMPER? üé®

SCAMPER stands for:
- **S**ubstitute: What can be substituted or replaced?
- **C**ombine: What can be merged or brought together?
- **A**dapt: What can be adjusted or modified from elsewhere?
- **M**odify: What can be emphasized, minimized, or altered?
- **P**ut to Another Use: How else can this be used?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed or simplified?
- **R**everse: What can be rearranged, inverted, or flipped?

## SCAMPER Template üìã

\`\`\`
**Challenge**: [Define the problem or opportunity]
**Current Solution**: [Existing approach or baseline]

**Substitute**: What if we replaced [X] with [Y]?
**Combine**: What if we merged [A] and [B]?
**Adapt**: What if we borrowed [concept] from [industry]?
**Modify**: What if we made [aspect] bigger/smaller/different?
**Put to Another Use**: What if we used this for [new purpose]?
**Eliminate**: What if we removed [component] entirely?
**Reverse**: What if we flipped [process/assumption]?
\`\`\`

## Practical SCAMPER Examples

### 1. Improving Team Meetings
**Challenge**: Weekly team meetings are boring and unproductive

**Substitute**: Replace conference room with walking meetings outdoors
**Combine**: Merge status updates with skill-sharing sessions
**Adapt**: Borrow "standup" format from agile development
**Modify**: Reduce meeting time from 60 to 25 minutes
**Put to Another Use**: Use meeting time for collaborative problem-solving
**Eliminate**: Remove status updates entirely (use async updates)
**Reverse**: Have team members lead meetings instead of managers

### 2. E-commerce Product Page Optimization
**Challenge**: Low conversion rates on product pages

**Substitute**: Replace static images with interactive 360¬∞ views
**Combine**: Merge product specs with customer review highlights
**Adapt**: Borrow "try before you buy" from physical retail
**Modify**: Enlarge social proof elements, minimize technical specs
**Put to Another Use**: Use product pages as educational content hubs
**Eliminate**: Remove unnecessary form fields from checkout
**Reverse**: Show benefits first, features second

### 3. Customer Onboarding Process
**Challenge**: High drop-off rates during user onboarding

**Substitute**: Replace lengthy tutorials with interactive walkthroughs
**Combine**: Merge setup process with immediate value demonstration
**Adapt**: Borrow gamification elements from mobile apps
**Modify**: Break complex setup into micro-steps
**Put to Another Use**: Use onboarding data for personalization
**Eliminate**: Remove non-essential setup steps
**Reverse**: Start with the end goal, work backward to setup

## Advanced SCAMPER Techniques

### Multi-Lens Combinations
Don't stop at single lenses‚Äîcombine them:
- **Substitute + Eliminate**: Replace complex feature with simple alternative
- **Combine + Modify**: Merge two services and scale them up
- **Adapt + Reverse**: Borrow a concept and flip its application

### Industry Cross-Pollination
Apply SCAMPER across different industries:
- **Healthcare ‚Üí Education**: Adapt patient monitoring for student progress
- **Gaming ‚Üí Fitness**: Combine achievement systems with workout routines
- **Hospitality ‚Üí Software**: Substitute technical support with concierge service

### Time-Based SCAMPER
Apply lenses across different time horizons:
- **Immediate**: What can we change today?
- **Short-term**: What can we modify this quarter?
- **Long-term**: What can we completely reimagine?

## SCAMPER by Use Case

### Product Development
- **Substitute**: Alternative materials, technologies, or approaches
- **Combine**: Feature integration, platform merging
- **Adapt**: Cross-industry inspiration, user behavior patterns
- **Modify**: Size, speed, frequency, intensity adjustments
- **Put to Another Use**: New market applications, different user segments
- **Eliminate**: Feature reduction, complexity removal
- **Reverse**: Opposite user flows, inverted value propositions

### Marketing Campaigns
- **Substitute**: Different channels, messaging, or audiences
- **Combine**: Multi-channel integration, cross-promotion
- **Adapt**: Successful campaigns from other industries
- **Modify**: Timing, frequency, or intensity changes
- **Put to Another Use**: Repurpose content across platforms
- **Eliminate**: Remove ineffective elements
- **Reverse**: Unexpected angles, contrarian positioning

### Business Process Improvement
- **Substitute**: New tools, team structures, or workflows
- **Combine**: Process integration, cross-functional collaboration
- **Adapt**: Best practices from other departments or companies
- **Modify**: Step sequences, approval levels, or timelines
- **Put to Another Use**: Repurpose existing resources
- **Eliminate**: Unnecessary steps, redundant approvals
- **Reverse**: Customer-driven processes, bottom-up decision making

## Common SCAMPER Pitfalls

‚ùå **Surface-Level Thinking**: Only considering obvious substitutions
‚úÖ **Solution**: Push each lens to generate 5-10 ideas before moving on

‚ùå **Single Lens Focus**: Only using favorite lenses (usually Substitute/Modify)
‚úÖ **Solution**: Force yourself through all 7 lenses systematically

‚ùå **Feasibility Filtering Too Early**: Rejecting "impossible" ideas immediately
‚úÖ **Solution**: Generate first, evaluate later. Wild ideas often lead to practical innovations

‚ùå **Generic Applications**: Using SCAMPER without specific context
‚úÖ **Solution**: Define clear constraints and success criteria upfront

## SCAMPER Facilitation Tips

### Solo Sessions
1. **Set Timer**: 10 minutes per lens to maintain momentum
2. **Quantity Over Quality**: Aim for 5+ ideas per lens
3. **Build on Ideas**: Use one lens's output as input for another
4. **Document Everything**: Even "bad" ideas can spark better ones

### Team Sessions
1. **Assign Lens Champions**: Have different people lead each lens
2. **Round-Robin**: Everyone contributes to each lens before moving on
3. **No Judgment Zone**: Defer evaluation until all lenses are complete
4. **Visual Mapping**: Use sticky notes or digital boards for collaboration

### Evaluation Criteria
After generating ideas, evaluate using:
- **Impact**: How much would this improve the situation?
- **Feasibility**: How realistic is implementation?
- **Resources**: What would this require to execute?
- **Risk**: What could go wrong?
- **Timeline**: How quickly could we test this?

## FAQ

**Q: How many ideas should I generate per lens?**
A: Aim for 3-5 quality ideas per lens. If you're stuck, push for quantity first‚Äî10 mediocre ideas often contain 2-3 gems.

**Q: What if some lenses don't seem relevant?**
A: Push through anyway. Often the "irrelevant" lenses produce the most innovative ideas.

**Q: How do I choose which ideas to pursue?**
A: Use impact/effort matrices, feasibility assessments, or rapid prototyping to test concepts.

**Q: Can I use SCAMPER for personal challenges?**
A: Absolutely! Apply it to career decisions, relationship issues, health goals, or any personal challenge.
