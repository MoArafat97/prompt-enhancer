# Balanced Scorecard for AI Prompts: Strategic Performance Measurement Framework ‚öñÔ∏è

**TL;DR**: Balanced Scorecard = Financial + Customer + Internal Process + Learning & Growth perspectives. Perfect for comprehensive performance measurement that balances short-term results with long-term strategic success.

The Balanced Scorecard, developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, is a strategic performance measurement framework that goes beyond traditional financial metrics. When applied to AI prompts, this framework helps organizations create comprehensive measurement systems that align performance indicators with strategic objectives across multiple perspectives.

## What is the Balanced Scorecard? üéØ

The Balanced Scorecard examines performance from four perspectives:
- **Financial**: Traditional financial measures and shareholder value
- **Customer**: Customer satisfaction, retention, and market share
- **Internal Process**: Operational efficiency and process excellence
- **Learning & Growth**: Employee capabilities, innovation, and organizational development

**Core Principle**: Balanced measurement across multiple perspectives provides a complete view of organizational performance and drives strategic alignment.
