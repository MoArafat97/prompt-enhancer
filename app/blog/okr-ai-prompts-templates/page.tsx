# OKR AI Prompts: Plan Objectives and Key Results with AI 🎯

**TL;DR**: Use AI to draft, refine, and align OKRs across teams. Includes templates for marketing, product, engineering, and sales teams with real examples and best practices.

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a powerful goal-setting framework used by companies like Google, Intel, and thousands of startups. AI can dramatically speed up OKR creation while ensuring alignment, measurability, and ambition.

## Why OKR + AI? 🚀

**Speed**: Draft quarterly OKRs in minutes, not hours
**Consistency**: Standardized quality across all teams
**Alignment**: Ensure OKRs connect to company strategy
**Measurability**: AI helps identify concrete metrics
**Iteration**: Quickly refine based on feedback

## OKR vs KPIs: What's the Difference?

| Aspect | OKRs | KPIs |
|--------|------|------|
| **Purpose** | Goal setting and alignment | Performance monitoring |
| **Timeframe** | Quarterly/annual | Ongoing |
| **Ambition** | Stretch goals (70% success) | Maintain standards (90%+ success) |
| **Focus** | Change and improvement | Status quo maintenance |
| **Examples** | "Increase NPS to 50" | "Monitor monthly churn rate" |

## Advanced OKR Prompting Techniques

### Cascade Prompting
Start with company OKRs, then cascade down:
1. Company OKRs → Department OKRs
2. Department OKRs → Team OKRs  
3. Team OKRs → Individual OKRs

### Alignment Checking
"Review these team OKRs and identify any misalignment with company priorities: [paste OKRs]"

### Risk Assessment
"Analyze these OKRs and identify the top 3 risks that could prevent success: [paste OKRs]"

### Metric Validation
"Evaluate whether these Key Results are truly measurable and outcome-focused: [paste KRs]"

## FAQ

**Q: How ambitious should OKRs be?**
A: Aim for 70% confidence in achieving them. If you hit 100% of OKRs, they weren't ambitious enough.

**Q: What if we don't hit our OKRs?**
A: That's expected! OKRs are stretch goals. Focus on learning and adjusting for next quarter.

**Q: How often should we review OKRs?**
A: Weekly team check-ins, monthly progress reviews, quarterly retrospectives.

**Q: Can individual contributors have OKRs?**
A: Yes, but focus on team OKRs first. Individual OKRs should align with team objectives.

**Q: How do OKRs relate to performance reviews?**
A: OKRs are for goal setting and alignment, not performance evaluation. Keep them separate.
