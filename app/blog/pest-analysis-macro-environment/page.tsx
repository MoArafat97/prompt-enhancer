# PEST Analysis for AI Prompts: Political, Economic, Social, Technological Environmental Analysis üåç

**TL;DR**: PEST = Political + Economic + Social + Technological. Perfect for analyzing macro-environmental factors that influence business strategy and identifying external opportunities and threats.

PEST Analysis is a strategic planning framework that examines the macro-environmental factors affecting an organization. When applied to AI prompts, this framework helps systematically evaluate external influences that could impact business decisions, market opportunities, and strategic planning.

## What is PEST Analysis? üéØ

PEST examines four key environmental factors:
- **Political**: Government policies, regulations, political stability, trade policies
- **Economic**: Economic growth, inflation, interest rates, employment levels
- **Social**: Demographics, cultural trends, lifestyle changes, education levels
- **Technological**: Innovation, automation, R&D activity, technology adoption

**Core Principle**: External environmental factors significantly influence business success - understanding these forces enables proactive strategic planning.
