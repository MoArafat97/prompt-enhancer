# BCG Matrix for AI Prompts: Business Portfolio Analysis (Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, Dogs) üìä

**TL;DR**: BCG Matrix = Stars + Cash Cows + Question Marks + Dogs. Perfect for portfolio analysis, resource allocation, and strategic investment decisions based on market growth and relative market share.

The BCG Matrix, developed by Boston Consulting Group, is a powerful strategic planning tool that helps businesses analyze their product or business unit portfolios. When applied to AI prompts, this framework enables systematic evaluation of investments, products, or initiatives to optimize resource allocation and strategic focus.

## What is the BCG Matrix? üéØ

The BCG Matrix categorizes business units into four quadrants:
- **Stars**: High growth, high market share (invest for growth)
- **Cash Cows**: Low growth, high market share (harvest for cash)
- **Question Marks**: High growth, low market share (selective investment)
- **Dogs**: Low growth, low market share (divest or maintain)

**Core Principle**: Balance portfolio investments by using cash from mature businesses to fund growth opportunities while divesting underperforming assets.

- **Update Regularly**: Market positions change frequently

### Investment Decision Criteria

## Common BCG Matrix Pitfalls ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Oversimplified Analysis
‚ùå Using only two dimensions without considering other strategic factors
‚úÖ Supplementing BCG with additional strategic analysis (competitive advantages, synergies)

### Static Perspective
‚ùå Treating current position as permanent
‚úÖ Analyzing trajectory and potential for movement between quadrants

### Ignoring Synergies
‚ùå Evaluating each business unit in isolation
‚úÖ Considering cross-business synergies and shared resources

### Poor Market Definition
‚ùå Using overly broad or narrow market definitions
‚úÖ Carefully defining relevant and addressable market boundaries

### Emotional Decision Making
‚ùå Keeping Dogs due to sentimental attachment
‚úÖ Making objective decisions based on strategic and financial criteria
