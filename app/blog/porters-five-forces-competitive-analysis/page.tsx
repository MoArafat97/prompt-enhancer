# Porter's Five Forces for AI Prompts: Competitive Analysis Framework for Market Positioning ‚öîÔ∏è

**TL;DR**: Porter's Five Forces = Competitive Rivalry + Supplier Power + Buyer Power + Threat of Substitutes + Threat of New Entrants. Perfect for comprehensive competitive analysis and strategic market positioning.

Porter's Five Forces is the gold standard for competitive analysis, developed by Harvard Business School's Michael Porter. When applied to AI prompts, this framework helps you systematically analyze market dynamics, competitive threats, and strategic opportunities to make informed business decisions.

## What is Porter's Five Forces? üèõÔ∏è

The five forces are:
- **Competitive Rivalry**: Intensity of competition among existing players
- **Supplier Power**: Bargaining power of suppliers in the value chain
- **Buyer Power**: Bargaining power of customers and their influence
- **Threat of Substitutes**: Risk of alternative products or services
- **Threat of New Entrants**: Barriers to entry and potential new competitors

**Core Principle**: Understanding these five forces reveals industry attractiveness and helps identify strategic positioning opportunities.

## Porter's Five Forces Best Practices ‚úÖ

### Research and Data Collection
- **Use Multiple Sources**: Industry reports, financial statements, customer surveys
- **Quantify When Possible**: Market share percentages, growth rates, margins
- **Update Regularly**: Forces change as industries evolve
- **Validate Assumptions**: Cross-check findings with industry experts

### Force Analysis Depth
- **Go Beyond Surface**: Don't just count competitors - analyze their strategies
- **Consider Dynamics**: How forces interact and influence each other
- **Think Future**: How might forces change in 3-5 years?
- **Segment Analysis**: Forces may vary by market segment or geography

### Strategic Implications
- **Identify Opportunities**: Where are forces weak or changing favorably?
- **Recognize Threats**: Which forces pose the greatest risks?
- **Competitive Positioning**: How can you influence or respond to each force?
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus investments where you can create advantages

## Common Porter's Five Forces Pitfalls ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Oversimplifying Force Ratings
‚ùå Rating everything as simply "High/Medium/Low"
‚úÖ Providing detailed analysis with supporting evidence and nuance

### Static Analysis
‚ùå Treating the analysis as a one-time snapshot
‚úÖ Regular updates as market conditions and competitive dynamics evolve

### Ignoring Force Interactions
‚ùå Analyzing each force in isolation
‚úÖ Understanding how forces influence and amplify each other

### Missing Industry Boundaries
‚ùå Defining the industry too narrowly or broadly
‚úÖ Carefully defining relevant market boundaries and segments

### Weak Supporting Evidence
‚ùå Making assumptions without data or research
‚úÖ Backing every assessment with credible sources and analysis

## Advanced Porter's Five Forces Techniques üöÄ

### Dynamic Five Forces Analysis
Track how forces change over time:
\`\`\`
**FORCE EVOLUTION TRACKING**
Current State: [Force assessment today]
3-Year Trend: [How has this force changed?]
Future Projection: [Expected changes in 3-5 years]
Strategic Implications: [How should strategy adapt?]
\`\`\`

### Weighted Five Forces
Assign importance weights to each force:
\`\`\`
**FORCE WEIGHTING** (Total = 100%)
Competitive Rivalry: 30% (Weight √ó Intensity = Impact Score)
Supplier Power: 15%
Buyer Power: 25%
Threat of Substitutes: 20%
Threat of New Entrants: 10%
**Overall Industry Attractiveness Score**: [Weighted average]
\`\`\`

### Segment-Specific Analysis
Different forces for different market segments:
\`\`\`
**ENTERPRISE SEGMENT**
- Higher switching costs
- More supplier power
- Lower price sensitivity

**SMB SEGMENT**
- Lower switching costs
- Less supplier power
- Higher price sensitivity
\`\`\`

### Force Interaction Mapping
Analyze how forces influence each other:
\`\`\`
**INTERACTION EFFECTS**
High Buyer Power ‚Üí Increases Competitive Rivalry
Low Entry Barriers ‚Üí Increases Substitute Threats
Strong Supplier Power ‚Üí Reduces New Entrant Threats
\`\`\`
