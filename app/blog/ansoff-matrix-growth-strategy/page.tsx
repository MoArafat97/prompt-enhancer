# Ansoff Matrix for AI Prompts: Growth Strategy Framework (Market Penetration, Development, etc.) üìà

**TL;DR**: Ansoff Matrix = Market Penetration + Market Development + Product Development + Diversification. Perfect for systematic growth strategy planning and risk assessment.

The Ansoff Matrix, developed by Igor Ansoff, is a strategic planning framework that helps businesses identify and evaluate growth opportunities. When applied to AI prompts, this matrix provides a systematic approach to analyzing growth options based on market and product dimensions, enabling data-driven expansion decisions.

## What is the Ansoff Matrix? üéØ

The Ansoff Matrix has four growth strategies:
- **Market Penetration**: Existing products in existing markets (lowest risk)
- **Market Development**: Existing products in new markets (medium risk)
- **Product Development**: New products in existing markets (medium risk)
- **Diversification**: New products in new markets (highest risk)

**Core Principle**: Growth strategies carry different risk levels - understand and plan accordingly while balancing growth ambitions with risk tolerance.
