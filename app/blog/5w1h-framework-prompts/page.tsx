# 5W1H Framework for AI Prompts: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How Analysis ‚ùì

**TL;DR**: 5W1H prompts use six fundamental questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) to ensure comprehensive analysis and complete information gathering. Perfect for thorough research and planning tasks.

The 5W1H framework is journalism's secret weapon for complete story coverage, and it's equally powerful for AI prompting. By systematically addressing Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How, you ensure no critical information is missed.

## What is the 5W1H Framework? üì∞

## Best Practices and Tips üí°

### 1. Start with the Most Important W
Begin with the question most critical to your situation:
- **Complex projects**: Start with "Why" (purpose and rationale)
- **Time-sensitive tasks**: Start with "When" (deadlines and timelines)
- **People-focused initiatives**: Start with "Who" (stakeholders and audience)

### 2. Use Sub-Questions for Depth
Expand each W with specific sub-questions:
\`\`\`
**Who**:
- Who are the primary stakeholders?
- Who makes the final decisions?
- Who will be impacted by this?
- Who has relevant expertise?
\`\`\`

### 3. Connect the Ws
Show relationships between different elements:
\`\`\`
**Integration**: How does the "Who" (target audience) influence the "How" (implementation method)?
\`\`\`

### 4. Prioritize Based on Impact
Not all Ws are equally important for every situation:
\`\`\`
**High Priority**: Who, What, Why (for strategic decisions)
**Medium Priority**: When, How (for execution planning)
**Context Dependent**: Where (varies by situation)
\`\`\`

## Advanced 5W1H Techniques üöÄ

### Layered 5W1H Analysis
Apply the framework at multiple levels:
\`\`\`
**Level 1 - Strategic**: Overall business objective
**Level 2 - Tactical**: Specific campaign or project
**Level 3 - Operational**: Individual tasks and activities

Each level gets its own 5W1H analysis.
\`\`\`

### Stakeholder-Specific 5W1H
Analyze from different perspectives:
\`\`\`
**Customer Perspective**:
- Who: End users and decision makers
- What: Problems they need solved
- Why: Pain points and motivations

**Business Perspective**:
- Who: Internal teams and partners
- What: Revenue and growth objectives
- Why: Market opportunity and competitive advantage
\`\`\`

### Time-Based 5W1H
Apply framework across different time horizons:
\`\`\`
**Short-term (Next 30 days)**:
- What: Immediate actions and quick wins
- When: Daily and weekly milestones

**Medium-term (Next 6 months)**:
- What: Major deliverables and campaigns
- How: Resource allocation and process optimization

**Long-term (Next 2 years)**:
- Why: Strategic vision and market positioning
- Where: Market expansion and new opportunities
\`\`\`

## Common 5W1H Mistakes ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Superficial Analysis
**Don't**: Give one-sentence answers to each W
**Do**: Provide comprehensive analysis with supporting details

### 2. Ignoring Connections
**Don't**: Treat each W in isolation
**Do**: Show how different elements relate and influence each other

### 3. Unbalanced Focus
**Don't**: Spend 80% of effort on one W
**Do**: Give appropriate attention to each relevant question

### 4. Static Analysis
**Don't**: Create one-time 5W1H analysis
**Do**: Update analysis as situations evolve
